A short paper examining retail investor trading activity on the ASX during the COVID-19 lockdown. Retail investors were net buyers of stock during this period, especially in high beta stocks, high leverage stocks, and stocks that had experienced large price declines. In contrast, institutional investors were net sellers sellers during the lockdown.
